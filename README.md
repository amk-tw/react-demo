# Getting Started

> Note: Under heavy active development, large changes will be mentioned here.

Repo Documentation Site: https://amk-tw.github.io/web-tech-showcase/

## Easy way

This is using moonrepo all the way.

```sh
./trunk
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install.sh | bash
moon setup
```

## Slightly More Complex

If you have tooling that can interpret the `.tool-versions` file that will setup you up for success, else just install the versions of the tools listed in it.

1. Click the gear icon, usually in the lower left side
2. Select "Profiles"
3. Select "Import Profile"
4. At the top of your screen it will ask for a URL or to "Select a local file"
5. Select a Local file
6. In the root of the repo the file is called `web-tech-showcase.code-profile`

## Tech Showcase

The primary goal of this repo is to have an ongoing demo of multiple web technologies that enables:

1. Quick exploring of new technologies with other frameworks and tools.
2. Testing Techniques for various common problems
