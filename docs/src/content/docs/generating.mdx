## Generating a New Library

To create a new React Library run this command:

```sh
moon generate react-lib libraries
```

You will then be prompted to give a name to the package. That name will be the package name as well.

### Adding Dependencies

To add a particular dependencies you can add it via PNPM with:

```sh
pnpm --filter <library-package-name> add <new-package>
```

> Note: you can get more precise by either making it a peer or dev dependency

## Generating a New component

> Work in progress

There is a template already added to the repo, but it currently doesn't work.

Broken way is to copy the files within `libraries/example/src/Button` and paste and modify as needed.
