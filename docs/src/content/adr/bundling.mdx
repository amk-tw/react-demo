## Context

Bundling is a nessasary step in any proper form of component libraries.

## Decision

[Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle) was chosen as the default bundler for packages as its made to stay out of the way and is not optiniated on how to test.

Considered options included [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) and [tsdx](https://tsdx.io/).

- Tsup has more things to consider and setup than Microbundle. CSS support is experimental
- tsdx is optiniated and forces in to Jest, usually good, but I want to do more experimenting with Vitest.

## Consequences

Need to create template generators for different testing options.
