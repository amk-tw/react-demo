## Context

Standardizing all linting and formatting across the repo makes maintenence easier.

## Decision

Trunk is a Rust based tool that can find and apply any and all linters to a repo. It also includes the ability to do actions automatically in the repo based on triggers, which include git-hooks which can make the initializing of any repo standardized for all contributers.

## Consequences

Customizations on linters and rules have some headaches, as the default configutations from Trunk want them to be scoped as small as possible. For most cases this is not a problem. With Astro.build which is in use is where the headache is because it uses a new file extension which is not recognized by default by Trunk.
