## Context

Choose between a multirepo and a monorepo.

## Decision

A mono repo was chosen to quickly showcase major variations in tooling without needing to rebuild or do extensive copy and pasting.

Keeping the overall project lean means that new tools can quickly be integrated and compared.

## Consequences

There is a bit of complexity on setup and CI pipelines.
